Conferences are one of the best ways I've found yet to combine meeting people, having fun and learning a heck load of information all in one place. Doesn't matter if you're a student, teacher,  worker, or enthusiastic amateur, there’s something for everyone and you’ll always wind up with at least one great story to take home.

With that in mind, I’ve thrown together a list of some of the best conferences close to home; people always seem to think that they need to travel to the ends of the world for these sorts of experiences, in the process missing the gold that’s lying right on their doorstep. 


**Linux.conf Australia (LCA)**

LCA was the first tech conference I ever attended, and remains my favourite. The core of the conference is open source, which lends itself to talks on astronomy, bioinformatics, and documentation, as well as the more mainstream talks you’d expect to see at such an event. It’s also one of only three major, international, grass-roots open-source conferences in the world! Any profit made goes into funding the event for next year, and the community involved is lovely and welcoming. Talks in 2015 covered such things as “Welcoming Everyone: Five Years of Inclusion and Outreach Programmes at PyCon Australia“ to “Five non-cryptographic hash functions enter. One hash function leaves.”. Multiple concurrent streams of talks means that there’s something for everyone (or at the very least, coffeeshops close by).

Another great thing about LCA is that they offer diversity scholarships to underrepresented groups in computing to attend the conference, covering both conference entry as well as accommodation and flights (if needed). Pretty fabulous.

*Date:* Early February every year

*Location:* ??? Somewhere in Australia; in the past we’ve had Geelong, Ballarat, and Auckland

*Cost:* $99! For five days of non stop learning! It’s a bargain if I ever saw one.

**KiwiCon**

KiwiCon is perhaps the most irreverent of the cons mentioned here. From their site:

> Kiwicon is the fourth best technical computer security conference in the Australia-Pacific region but remains triumphant as New Zealand's best (only) hacker conference. Organised by a masochistic cabal of the security community, Kiwicon attempts to bring together the commercial infosec industry, academics, students, and hobbyist hackers to discover the new, the interesting, and technologically crackin'. 
>
> First run in 2007, by now Kiwicon has gained reputation, size, and an extra cleaning run for the men's toilets. Attendance in 2014 was around 1300 people (although we do not claim all of them are paying attention) plus 30 or so speakers, staff and crue.

As you may have gleaned from the above, their focus is security, from the internet of things to the latest crypto. The talks are often accessible even with rudimentary knowledge, and its a great place to learn more about what’s happening in the field!

If you have kids you want to lend to them, they’ll also teach them lockpicking and crypto (which are definitely skills to teach your kids).

*Date:* Early to mid December every year

*Location:* New Zealand (I mean, Kiwis, so…)

*Cost:* NZ$30. Holy hell is this well priced. Make a kiwi friend, turn it into a holiday, and learn some major stuff.

**UX Australia**
 
As the name may suggest, this conference is aimed at user experience and design work. It has a combination of hands on workshops, as well as lectures, and is broad in scope (always fun).

From the site:

> The main conference presentations cover a wide range of UX-related topics – from practical techniques and case studies; to designing experiences for new contexts; to just getting inspired to do great work.They cover a range of technologies (or no technologies at all); and also discuss the perennial problem of getting better work done in large organisations.

Another bonus is the range of social events included as part of the conference, aimed at getting people within (and without) the industry to meet new people in a less formal setting. There are pre-drinks, post-drinks, and arranged dinners during the conference which is a pretty impressive spread!

As well as the main conference, they also host smaller workshops and talk days throughout the year in a variety of cities. Narrower in scope, most of the ones for 2016 already seem to be planned already!

*Date:* End of August

*Location:* Brisbane

*Cost:* $740 for the two day conference, which is a bit of a hit to the pocket (although it does include most food, which is nice).

**RUXCON**

RUXCON is potentially the biggest security conference in the APAC region (its definitely the best known in my circles). Functionally, it’s the Australian version of DEFCON but with less casinos and more Australian slang. Highlights include a CTF competition, multiple parties, a hardware hacking village, as well as a myriad of talks. 

From the site:

> Ruxcon is a computer security conference brings together the best and the brightest security talent within the Aus-Pacific region. The conference is a mixture of live presentations, activities and demonstrations presented by security experts. Ruxcon is widely regarded as a leading computer security conference within Australia attracting all facets of the security landscape.
>
> Ruxcon provides a provides a laid back environment for our delegates to engage and collaborate with a broad spectrum of like-minded students, enthusiasts, hackers, and security professionals. 
Speakers are global, and the concepts discussed super interesting. Just like with KiwiCon, you don't need to be a L337 H4K3R to attend and get a lot from the events. 

*Date:* End of October

*Location:* Melbourne

*Cost:* ~$300 for a two day (and three night) conference, which is pretty solid.

**Webstock**

Webstock is a conference dedicated to web technologies (as you may have guessed from the name!). As well as implementation topics, the talks cover a broad range of interconnected fields such as  accessibility, usability, design and development practices, making it a holistic experience. Engagement is the name of the game, and this group are right up there. Their website is the shiniest I’ve seen in a long time, as well as being content rich (yay!):

> Webstock itself is a celebration of the web and its makers – the creativity, the magic, the craft and everything in between.
>
> It features industry leaders and kick-ass speakers talking on a very wide range of topics and is attended by very possibly the most talented, charming and delightful people in the world, ever. 

They even have a page you can use to convince your boss to send you!

The one downside of this conference is that it’s hella expensive (to the tune of $1595, eep!). Its saving grace is that they do offer 20 scholarships a year, both for economic hardship and under represented groups in tech. If you fall into either of those categories, definitely apply.  

*Date:* Mid February

*Location:* Wellington

*Cost:* $1595 that’s a lot of dough. Definitely apply for a scholarship if able.

**Game Connect Asia Pacific (GCAP)**

Hosted by the Game Developer’s Association of Australia, this conference focuses on game development, from skills enhancement to trends in industry. 

> GCAP delivers thought provoking, creative and innovative sessions covering programming, art, design, management and more, from leaders in the local and international game development industry.

An element of the conference that is great to see is the student showcase, dedicated to showing student works (as well as the professional ones that delegates expect to see). The number of female presenters (in 2015 at least) was also great to see!

Pleasingly, they also offer scholarships for those without the financial means to attend on their own coin. Unlike many other scholarships, this one also offers rebates for travel and accommodation if necessary!

*Date:* End of October

*Location:* Melbourne

*Cost:* ??? There doesn’t seem to be a record of this on the internet that I can find, sigh. We’ll have to wait until next year’s announced to find out.
